This is an ugly little Movable Type plugin that borrows heavily from John Goulah's NET::Akamai module. When an entry in Movable Type is edited (and has a status of 2, meaning it's published), a purge request is made to Akamai's SOAP API using the username and password you specify in the plugin settings at the system level. You'll receive the response email at the address you specify in the settings, and the outcome of the request will be logged to MT's system log.

This plugin is implementation-specific to a degree, in that the installation I administer uses PHP to paginate entries, splitting pages on a '<pb />' tag. Thus, the purge request will attempt to purge the URL and ?page=1 - if any <pb /> tags are found, it will additionally request ?page=2, ?page=3, etc., as needed.

My Perl skills are non-existent currently, but I do have plans to refactor this plugin to clean it up and enhance the available settings. Also, it should be extended to cover more object types, e.g. pages, templates, etc.

NOTE: When changing your Akamai password, the change can take up to 30 minutes or so to propagate fully, so you may see failures in the log for a bit.

To install:
1. Copy to your MT plugins directory, e.g. "<your MT location>/plugins/"
2. Go to System Overview -> Tools -> Plugins -> Akamai Cache Purge Plugin 0.1 and fill in the settings
3. Enjoy
